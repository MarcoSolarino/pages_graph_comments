# Overview
Given an undirecred graph G, a Maximal Clique is an induced sugraph of G that is complete (clique) and to which no other adjacent vertex can be added.

In this project are implemented:
- **Algorithm that builds an undirected graph given a subset of OEISÂ® in JSON format**
- **Algorithm that given a graph G and a vertex v, finds a non trivial maximal clique**
- **Bron-Kerosch without pivoting**
- **Bron-Kerbosch with pivoting**
- **Bron-Kerbosch using a degeneracy order of the nodes of the graph**
- **Algorithm that finds a maximal clique of max size**
